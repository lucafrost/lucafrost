- 👋 Hi, I’m Luca, founder at https://whisp.ai & BSc Politics + Int'l relations student at the London School of Economics.
- 👀 I’m interested in combining my understanding of politics with AI/ML to create solutions to build a better world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift (finally venturing out of my backend comfort zone)!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that falls in the nexus of AI and social issues.
